<p>The data which we have interest in is information released by Shell relating to oil spills experienced by the company in the Niger Delta (Nigeria).  This is released monthly on their website and features a table of the events, as well as PDF documents photographing the incident as well as the original written report by the Shell manager responsible.</p>

<p>Shell has responded to a freedom of information request and added the scanned reports of each incident to the tabular report.  We would like to transcribe these reports specifically, the table with longitude and latitude.</p>
